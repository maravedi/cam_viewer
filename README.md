# cam_viewer
A simple procedural PHP application for viewing several IP camera streams on one page.

This application needs a lot of additional work done to it.  At the time of creation it was working fine,
but it has been a while since it was first created.  Similarly, I was not very aware of responsive design
when I created this, so the styling is not very user friendly.
